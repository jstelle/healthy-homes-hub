                                                    <p>Home energy efficiency is important for many reasons. It helps lower your monthly utility bill, protects your belongings from wear and tear, and can even save you money on your insurance premiums. When it comes to homeownership, it can be intimidating to think about all of the different things that go into making your house “green.” Fortunately, there are many things you can do to make your home more energy efficient. Even small changes, like installing weather-stripping or changing lightbulbs to LEDs, can make a big difference over time. Here are some ideas to get started:</p><h2>Install New Windows</h2><p>New windows are one of the most effective ways to make your home more energy efficient. However, you should only install windows that are code-compliant in your area. This is because new windows can help lower your energy bill by up to 30%. The best way to figure out if your windows are code-compliant is to contact your local building department. If your home already has old, drafty windows, they may not be code-compliant. In this case, you may want to consider replacing them instead of installing new windows.If your home is relatively new, you may have new, energy-efficient windows that have already been installed. Before you make any further improvements to your home, make sure to test these windows to make sure they are properly installed and working properly. This way, you can be sure that they are maximizing your energy efficiency.</p><h2>Change Your Lighting</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to make your home more energy efficient is to change your lighting. You can lower your energy bill by up to 15% by making simple adjustments to your lighting. This includes installing new lightbulbs or adjusting your current bulbs to a lower wattage. Another option is to install dimmer switches in your main living areas to make them brighter when you need them to be.When it comes to lighting, you’ll want to make sure that you are using the right bulbs for each room. For example, if you have a living room with a lot of natural light, you may want to use a light bulb that is a warmer or yellow tint. If you have a room with less light, you may want to use a cool white light bulb.If you’re not sure which bulbs to use in your home, you can use an online energy saving calculator. This will tell you which bulbs are most efficient for each room in your home.</p><h2>Change Your Air Filter</h2><p>Another easy way to make your home more energy efficient is to change your air filter. Your air filter will trap harmful particles in your home that can cause allergies and respiratory issues. If your air filter is clogged, it can prevent your air conditioner and/or heater from working as efficiently. You can check your filter by placing a white sheet of paper in your air conditioning or heating vents. If the paper turns a darker color, it means your filter needs to be changed.If you’re not sure when your filter needs to be changed, you can use an online energy saving calculator to find out. It will tell you when your filter needs to be changed based on your home’s size and type of heating and cooling system.</p><h2>Add or Upgrade a/c and Heating System</h2><p>If you’re in a warmer climate, you may want to consider upgrading your a/c and heating system. This way, you can lower your energy bill by up to 10%. If you already have an a/c and heating system in your home, you may want to consider adding more units.
