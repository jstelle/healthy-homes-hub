                                                    <p>Home is where we spend a large portion of our lives. It’s also the place where we come back to each day after work and school. Our homes reflect our personalities and interests, and they also tend to reflect our health. If you’ve been feeling run down or have noticed a change in your health since moving into your home, read on for some tips on how to make your home healthier. Healthy living at home doesn’t have to mean a diet of veggies and grains. With some small changes, you can make your home a more comfortable and healthy place to live. Keep reading for some ideas that will make your home healthier.</p><h2>Install a fresh air ventilation system</h2><p>The first step to making your home healthier is to install a fresh air ventilation system. This will help reduce the amount of household toxins in your home, which can lead to poor indoor air quality. Air duct cleaning should be done once every 12-18 months, especially if you have pets or young children. The best place to install your fresh air ventilation system is in your attic. This is where most household toxins are generated, and it’s also the best place to trap them. You can also install an air filter in your living room, bedroom, and kitchen.</p><h2>Add plants</h2><p>Plants have been shown to reduce stress and improve mood, and they are also known to purify the air in your home. They can also help remove harmful carbon dioxide from the air, making it easier for you and your family to breathe. Plants have also been shown to remove toxins from the air, which can be dangerous for your health if they are not removed. Plants can be placed in your kitchen, living room, or bedroom, depending on where you spend the most time. They can also be placed in your bathroom, bedroom, or kitchen as a natural air purifier. Remember to clean your plants regularly to remove dust and dirt. This can help prevent pests from infesting your plants and will also help them grow faster.</p><h2>Install a carbon monoxide detector</h2><p>Carbon monoxide is a gas that is produced when fuel is burned incompletely. It is poisonous and can cause serious health issues. Carbon monoxide detectors can be installed in your kitchen, bedroom, or living room. They are inexpensive and can alert you if there is a problem with your heating system. Carbon monoxide detectors are important for people with pets or young children, as they are more likely to develop carbon monoxide poisoning. They are also important for people who smoke, as carbon monoxide build-up can be caused by smoking in the home.</p><h2>Clean your home regularly</h2><p>It may sound like common sense, but keeping your home clean can help reduce the amount of toxins in your home. Keeping your floors clean can remove dust and dirt, which can be harmful to your health. Keeping your kitchen and bathroom clean can help remove toxins that are found in household cleaning products. Keeping your floors and kitchen clean can also help reduce the amount of time you spend cleaning. This can be especially helpful for people who work full time and have little time to clean. Keeping your floors clean can also help prevent slips and falls, which are a leading cause of injury among the elderly.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Home is where we spend most of our time, and it also reflects our personalities and interests. If your home is not as healthy as you would like it to be, it can be a source of stress and unhappiness. Small changes can help make your home healthier and more comfortable. A fresh air ventilation system, adding plants, installing a carbon monoxide detector, and cleaning your home regularly are just a few ways you can make your home healthier.</p>
